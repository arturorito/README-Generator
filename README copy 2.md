# README-Generator
This application helps create general README files for a new repository. Questions are asked to create and fill the data needed for a README file.

```bash
node index.js
```
Because this application won’t be deployed, you’ll also need to provide a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality. Revisit the Screencastify Tutorial in the prework as a refresher on how to record video from your computer. You’ll need to submit a link to the video _and_ add it to the README of your project.

## User Story
